          <h2>Sir William Shakespeare and His Wise Words</h2>
          <p class="post-date">Published on: September 17, 2024</p>
          <p class="post-excerpt">All the world‚Äôs a stage,
            And all the men and women merely players:
            They have their exits and their entrances;
            And one man in his time plays many parts,
            His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
            Mewling and puking in the nurse‚Äôs arms.</p>
            <p>
            Then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel
            And shining morning face, creeping like snail
            Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
            Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
            Made to his mistress‚Äô eyebrow.</p> <p>Then a soldier,
            Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,
            Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,
            Seeking the bubble reputation
            Even in the cannon‚Äôs mouth.</p> <p>And then the justice,
            In fair round belly with good capon lined,
            With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
            Full of wise saws and modern instances;
            And so he plays his part.</p> <p>The sixth age shifts
            Into the lean and slippered pantaloon,
            With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,
            His youthful hose well saved, a world too wide
            For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
            Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
            And whistles in his sound.</p> <p>Last scene of all,
            That ends this strange eventful history,
            Is second childishness and mere oblivion,
            Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.‚Äù</p>
