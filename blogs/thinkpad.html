          <h2>Some Background Information</h2>
            <p>
            Thinkpads are some of the most versitile computers, with thier excellence in repairability and servicing, they have become a fan favourite around the tech community. Dating back to the IBM Thinkpad created back in the 90's as primarily an office computer. They have always exceeded in thier classes as a portable computer. Since then, Lenovo has taken over the prodution and salesof the thinkpad. Unfortunately, the modern thinkpad has strayed away from its easy repairability, servicing and, overall aesthetic, as it inches towards how modern day laptops are; garbage within 2 years. Now nerds like me love a computer like this, load up a light weight distro on the thinkpad, create some cool configs, and the computer is as good as new! (well not quite, but you get the gist). So that is exactly what I was on the quest to do!

            It was the day of the 22nd and the quest was to attain the thinkpad, after a bargaining battle, I had finally gotten my hands on a Lenovo Thinkpad X200 T(ablet)<a href="https://www.laptopcloseout.ca/media/catalog/product/cache/c94645ec1e5bfa8c564d41c8619f6a96/l/e/lenovo-thinkpad-x200-12-o.jpg"> ðŸ”—</a>. This was the cool version, as it could turn into a tablet with a touchscreen, but when the device came into my hands, I was shocked to realize, It had no battery or charger. So it is yet to know if the device even turns on, so in the mean time a charger comes in the mail, I worked on the OS of the system.

            To work on the operating system, I had to find an HDD or, SSD
